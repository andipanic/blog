Today begins a new journey in my life. I have decided to start working on a blog in my free time. At the moment I have a feeling the blog will be comprised of software thoughts or ideas and the arts.

I tend to write fictional stories in my free time. I hope at some point I’ll be able to finish some of the short stories and somewhat longer stories. Oddly, there never seems to be time for writing, which is a shame.

I’d like to break that shameless habbit and stuff it in the trash where it belongs. I feel like I’ve spent too much time not working on the arts… And I spent three or four years worth of my college career working towards fine arts. Truly a shame.

Speaking of fine arts, I’d also like to include some sketches or drawings - drawrings as I like to call them - on or within this blog somewhere. It would be a pity to spend all that time in school learning about color theory and shapes to realise it all went down some tube that leads to a place far from the back, front, sides, or even tops and bottoms of my brain.

As trump says, lets make this blog great. I mean really great.
